# About Me

---

## 👋 Hi, I’m [@MyndPhreak](https://github.com/MyndPhreak) or just MYND

I'm an enthusiastic learner, ADHD sufferer, and Autism enjoyer. I also cook and clean, and I like long walks on the beach.
I love Vue and C#, and really like starting projects that I then always leave half finished, never to be looked at again.

## 🌱 My Current Projects

- **Cards Against Humanity (Web Game):**
  - Really just a made from scratch Cards against Humanity Web Game written in Vue, with the Nuxt 3 framework as the bones, and a realtime Appwrite backend for user auth and databases.
  - Current progress on it is stalled because I, for some reason, decided to start 15 other projects at the same time.
  - Custom shuffling functions, lobby stuff, auth, whatever.
  
- **Teletext Simulator:**
  - Remember those 90's Teletext screens on TV where you need to push numbers to see stuff like
  - Local Weather
  - News
  - That's it
